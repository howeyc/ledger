.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command-line accounting tool based on the power and completeness
of double-entry accounting.  It is only a reporting tool, which means it never
modifies your data files, but it does offer a large selection of reports, and
different ways to customize them to your needs. It also offers a command to 
import a csv file and output them into ledger format. Plus a web service
interface to view reports with charts/tables.
.Sh REPORT COMMANDS
.Nm
accepts several top-level commands, each of which generates a different
kind of basic report.  Most of them accept an optional
.Ar account-filter
argument, in order to determine what should be reported.  To understand the
syntax of a
.Ar account-filter ,
see the section on
.Sx FILTERS .
In its most basic form, simply specifying one or more strings produces a
report for all accounts containing those strings.
.Pp
The following is a complete list of reporting commands:
.Bl -tag -width balance
.It Ic accounts Oo Ar account-filter Oc
Print a list of sorted accounts for postings that match
.Ar account-filter . 
Options available for this command are:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "--begin-date (b) YYYY-mm-dd "
.It Fl \-begin-date ( Fl b ) Ar YYYY-mm-dd
Begin date of transactions to include in processing.
.It Fl \-end-date ( Fl e ) Ar YYYY-mm-dd
End date of transactions to include in processing.
.It Fl \-leaves-only Pq Fl l
Only show accounts with highest depth in a given account hierarchy.
.It Fl \-match-depth Pq Fl m
Requires one
.Ar account-filter
to be specified. Prints accounts that match the same depth (separators)
of supplied filter.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ic accounts
command is used to provide autocomplete functionality in the vim-ledger plugin.
.It Ic balance Oo Ar account-filter Oc
Print a balance report showing totals for postings that match
.Ar account-filter ,
and aggregate totals for parents of those accounts.  Options available for 
this command are:

This is a display predicate, which means it only affects display,
not the total calculations.  In register reports,
